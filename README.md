# meemstr

This is a prototype mobile app built with React Native. The idea is to swipe left or right on memes as they are displayed,
just like Tinder.

##Future Work

* So far, the results of a user's choices aren't utilized in any way. Let's do something with the information!
* It's possible to run out of memes. Need to be able to pull infinite memes. 
* Find a meme API that includes the text with the images 

## Running the app

From the project directory: `npm start`

You may need to install Expo. You can scan the QR code with a phone, or press `i` to start the iOS simulator.
